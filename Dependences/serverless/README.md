# Serverless
### How to set up a serverless service using AWS lambda and docker

we will be using various technologies
> * docker
> * AWS lambda
> * python 

Here we assume you already have **docker** installed. we are going to set an container to make petitions in a serverless contatiner, which actually is redundant coinsidering that a docker container is actually serverless. We are using the api of amazon web services Lambda, and their docker image in linux.

In the docker file we used the python linux distribution, which includes the required components to run functions packaged as container images on AWS Lambda, the runtime for a given language(python in our case), dependencies and the Lambda Runtime Interface Client (RIC), which implements the Lambda Runtime API.

This is just an ilustrative implementation, and still needs a lot of work the official [**amazon docs**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python.html)on this are a lot more extensive on process descriptions, and about the lambda api which has it's own console https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python.html or even for more info check the amazon guide https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless/latest/devguide/welcome.html 

## Container
you need 3 files one `lambda_func.py`, obviously a `Dockerfile` and some config file for requeriments if thats the case
#### Dockerfile
```
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.11.2024.09.06.09
```
That is the source linux image, which you can change picking from here https://gallery.ecr.aws/lambda/python

```
CMD [ "lambda_func.handler" ]
```
this other line of code is important because you set the CMD to your handler 

### docker build and run
 
```
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t docker-image:test .
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -p 9000:8080 docker-image:test
```
doing that you can send the command to watch if your container is running fine
```
curl "http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations" -d '{}'
```

the next step would be using the AWS lambda resources line ECR to upload and having it not running locally
